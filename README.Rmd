## README

fabryka is an open access R *shiny* user-friendly web application dedicated to the fabric analysis of archaeological or geological assemblage. fabryka uses classical analytical procedures (Benn, rose, Schmidt and Woodcock diagrams and statistical tests on orientations) for analysing the fabrics of objects, an spatial method and new ways of spatial and statistical exploration. A descriptive article is available at <https://zenodo.org/records/15236695>.

## USE fabryka

The web application is available online at <https://marchaeologist.shinyapps.io/fabryka/>.

You can also use fabryka in RStudio. To do so :
